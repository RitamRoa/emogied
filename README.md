# emogied
a crazy chrome extension that converts your images to random emojis - best and barely works when internet goes down. 

### how to run.
   1. you know the drill, clone the repo and save it.
      incase this is your first time at git :)

      open vs code or any of your favorite ide and run

      git clone https://github.com/RitamRoa/emogied.git

      and save it. 

  2.  Open Chrome browser and go to extension or I made your work even simpler just copy paste the command below at search bar.

      chrome://extensions

      enable the "Developer Mode", using the toggle switch at the top-right corner.

  3. Click on "Load Unpacked" and open the folder of "Emogied"

  4. Go to any of your favorite webpages (For Eg : Github Profile ) and turn on the extension by clicking on Chaos Toggle Switch.

That's About it, Hope you like it :)
